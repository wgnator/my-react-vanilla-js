# my-react-vanilla-js

My own challenge to implement functional React (using hooks) from scratch in plain javascript (WIP)

## Objectives
- build functional React library with basic hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, etc.).
- do not use any external libraries, build with only plain javascript.
- do not use class declarations(ES6), instead make full use of closures & plain objects & prototypes & constructor.
